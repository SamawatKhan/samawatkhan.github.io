Hello There! This is Samawat Khan, an undergraduate physics student at Brac University. My interests in physics stem from childhood curiosities about the nature around myself. It started off with magnets and kept on growing bigger, with each passing day I found myself having more unanswered questions than actual answers eventually leading me to choose physics in the end. I have been considering to specialize in Statistical Field Theory for now but that is subject to change given the circumstances. My other adjacent academic interests involve mathematics and theoretical computer science while nonadjacent ones involve certain sub branches of philosophy namely ethics and epistemology. I'm also a sucker for the history of physics, maths and philosophy in general. Speaking of hobbies, there isn't much here besides video games. I'd like to be a teacher one day.
