Hello There! This is Samawat, an undergraduate physics student at Brac University. My academic interests are generally contained within physics and maths while other interests involve philosophy, namely sub branches such as ethics and epistemology. Speaking of hobbies, there isn't much to add here besides video games. I'd like to be a teacher one day. Also since you are visiting this page already, don't forget to check out my [notes](https://samawatkhan.github.io/notes/). I know it's incomplete but you never know what you might find one day. Cheers!
