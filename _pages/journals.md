Nothing to see here for now. This is where you will find my journals if I ever write any on topics I'm interested in. Some topics I can write long essays on include but are not limited to antinatalism, philosophy of vision, pessimism, video games and so on. I hope I can write a few before passing away at least.

Stay tuned in case I drop anything later.
